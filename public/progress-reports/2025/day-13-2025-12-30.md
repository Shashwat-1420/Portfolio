## 🎯 Primary Focus
Integrating advanced image processing filters and sensor data classification for the navigation module.

---

## ✅ Done Today
- [x] Implemented a **Toeplitz Matrix** based transformation for optimized signal processing.
- [x] Developed a **Minimum pixel value overlay** algorithm to enhance feature detection in high-noise frames.
- [x] Calibrated and integrated **Proximity sensors** into the real-time feedback loop.

## 💡 Learned
- The mathematical efficiency of using Toeplitz matrices for representing convolution operations in discrete systems.
- How **Logistics Regression (ML)** can be effectively utilized for binary classification of obstacle proximity based on raw sensor input.

## 🚧 Challenges
- Tuning the threshold for the minimum pixel value overlay to avoid washing out low-contrast details.
- Managing interrupt latency when reading from multiple proximity sensors simultaneously.

## 🧠 Thoughts & Reflection
The shift towards using Logistics Regression for sensor state classification significantly reduced the false-positive rate compared to simple thresholding. The matrix-based approach for signal processing is showing great performance gains.

## 🔭 Plan for Tomorrow
- [Priority 1] Refine the ML model parameters for higher accuracy in edge cases.
- [Priority 2] Optimize the memory footprint of the Toeplitz transformations.

## 🧘 Gratitude
1. Productive debugging session.
2. Robust sensor hardware.
3. Clean documentation.
