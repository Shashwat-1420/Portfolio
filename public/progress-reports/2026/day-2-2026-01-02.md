## 🎯 Primary Focus
<!-- What was the ONE main thing you wanted to achieve today? -->
> Complete user authentication module with login and signup forms

---

## ✅ Done Today
<!-- Use - [x] for done, - [ ] for partial. Be specific! -->
- [x] Implemented JWT authentication backend
- [x] Built login and signup React components
- [x] Connected frontend to authentication API

## 💡 Learned
<!-- Technical concepts, soft skills, or life lessons. Use `code` for keywords -->
- `JWT tokens` persist user sessions without server-side storage
- Error handling in async/await prevents cryptic bugs later
- Component reusability saves development time significantly

## 🚧 Challenges
<!-- What stuck? What was hard? Great for tracking patterns over time -->
- CORS errors consumed 30 minutes of debugging
- Password validation regex initially too restrictive

---

## 🧠 Thoughts & Reflection
<!-- Brain dump! How did you feel? What gave you energy? What drained it? -->
Started slow with configuration issues, but breakthrough came after lunch. Felt energized seeing authentication working end-to-end. Team feedback was encouraging.

## 🔭 Plan for Tomorrow
<!-- Set yourself up for success. Limit to top 3 priorities -->
- Add password reset functionality
- Write unit tests for auth module
- Implement user profile page

## 🧘 Gratitude
<!-- 3 simple things. Rewires brain for positivity. -->
1. My mentor's quick debugging help
2. Supportive team feedback
3. Hot coffee breaks
